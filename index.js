import { fileURLToPath } from "url"; /* This line imports the `fileURLToPath`
 function from Node.jsâ€™s built-in `url` module. In modern JavaScript projects,
  especially those using ES modules (with `import`/`export` syntax), 
  file paths are often represented as file URLs (for example, `file:///C:/path/to/file.js`). 
  // The `fileURLToPath` function is used to convert these file URLs into standard file system 
  // paths that Node.js can work with (like `C:\path\to\file.js` on Windows or `/path/to/file.js` on Unix systems).

    This is particularly useful when you need to determine the actual file path of the current module 
    or when working with file operations that require a traditional path string. 
    By importing `fileURLToPath`, 
    your code can reliably handle file paths in a way that is compatible
    across different operating systems and Node.js environments.*/
